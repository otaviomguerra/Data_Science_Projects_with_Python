# Data_Science_Projects_with_Python
Here are some of my personal practices in data science using Python as the main tool.

The projects here are coded in Python and always will be described step-by-step using Jupyter notebooks. Feel free to download they and their related dataset to do whatever you want. The datasets will always come from free sources.

The purpose of this repository is to show my personal abilities with Data Analysis and Machine Learning and, at the same time, help someone interested in learn something from these notebooks presented in here.

Ot√°vio Guerra,
